# Topsis-Arshdeep-102303561
TOPSIS( Technique for order for preference by similarity to Ideal solution ) for MCDM (Multiple criteria decision making) in Python compiled by Arshdeep Kaur, 102303561, TIET, Patiala.

## Installation
Use the package manager pip to install Topsis-Arshdeep-102303561.
```pip install Topsis-Arshdeep-102303561```

## Usage
Enter csv filename followed by .csv extentsion, then enter the weights vector with vector values separated by commas, followed by the impacts vector with comma separated signs (+,-) and enter the output file name followed by .csv extension.
The program is executed using the file named program.py, which serves as the main entry point for running all commands.
```python <program.py> <InputDataFile as .csv> <Weights as a string> <Impacts as a string> <ResultFileName as .csv>```

### Example
```python __main__.py data.csv "1,1,1,1,1" "+,+,+,+,+" result.csv```

## Please Note That"

The first column and first row are removed by the library before processing, in attempt to remove indices and headers. So the csv MUST follow the format as shown in data.csv shown in the Example section.
The input data file MUST contain three or more columns.
The second to last columns of the data file MUST contain NUMERIC values.
The number of weights, impacts and columns (second to last) MUST be SAME.
Impacts MUST either be '+' or '-'.
Impacts and Weights MUST be separated by , (comma).
